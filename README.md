# yield_optimizer
Yield Optimizer is a decentralized smart contract built using the Anchor framework on the Solana blockchain. It automatically reallocates funds between various DeFi protocols to maximize yield based on current rates and market conditions. The smart contract interacts with DeFi protocols such as Raydium, Serum, and Solend, optimizing user yield while ensuring proper governance and fee collection.
This project is still in test mode and was made 100% in Solana playground ide
